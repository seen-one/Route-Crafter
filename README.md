# üõ£Ô∏è Route Crafter

Route Crafter is a web app to automatically generate the most efficient .gpx route covering every street in an area. Created by me to generate routes to collect my own street-view/360 imagery for [Google Street View, Mapillary, Panoramax etc.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Street-level_imagery_services)

## Search Map
If you know the name of a place and want to quickly jump there, you can use the search map feature. This is not required as part of route generation.

## Find Areas
There are different types of areas you can choose. Firstly, you can use OpenStreetMap areas:
* Landuse: Residential/Retail/Commercial/Industrial
* Admin Level 10
* Admin Level 9
* Admin Level 8
* Admin Level 7
* Boundary: Neighborhood
* Boundary: Political
* Boundary: Census
* Place: Suburb
* Place: Quarter
* Place: Postal code
* Place: District
* Place: Subdistrict
Click on multiple areas to generate a single route for a larger area. If the areas selected don't quite connect, you can expand the surrounding area by increasing the buffer.

Are the OpenStreetMap areas unsuitable? There are some additional options you can choose:
* 500m x 500m grid
* 1km x 1km grid
* 1.5km x 1.5km grid
* Draw your own area! (additional buttons will appear under the zoom buttons)

## Fetch Roads
Once you have picked your areas, click 'Fetch Roads', it will show the paths based on all of your filters (see below).

## Generate Route
If the fetched paths look ok, set the starting location by right clicking on the map. Press 'Generate Route' to run ArcRoutingLibrary solver to create the path solution.

Sometimes, you may get a warning that not all of the paths were not able to be connected. This can be because the boundary or some filters have caused a split of paths into sections, or it could be a one-way path at the boundary making it impossible to reconnect to other paths. 'Allow navigation past boundary' with Windy Rural can help re-connect the paths which gives the option for the solver to use the these as optional paths. You can choose to continue anyways, where only the largest section of the split will be used to create the route.

## Play Route
Like a media player, you can play, pause, drag to seek, change the speed of a preview of the route.

## Route Solvers
To be able to find the most efficient route, we use the [Chinese Postman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_postman_problem) theory and its variants. There are different solvers to choose from, depending on your needs where some will create a shorter route than others.

| Solver | Oversimplified Description |
|--|--|
| Windy Rural (Benavent) | Improved version of the Win solver |
| Windy Rural (Win) | Mixed + Can specify paths that are optional |
| Mixed (Yaoyuenyong) | Improved version of the Frederickson solver |
| Mixed (Frederickson)| Single direction for one-way but otherwise bi-directional |
| Undirected | Treats all paths as bi-directional (Even one-way paths) |
| Directed | All sides of a path (i.e. both sides for bi-directional paths) |

## Coverage Overlays and Filter
Hover on the layers menu (or tap on touch screen) to see the option to show Mapillary, Panoramax, KartaView and Mapilio coverage (or change the map layer!). You need to zoom in the map enough to be able to select and view the overlay. If an overlay is enabled and you zoom too far out, the map will turn slightly grey.

Due to limitation with the KartaView API, filtering or skip route sections is not available for KartaView.

### Coverage Filter
You can apply date, image type and User ID filters which will reflect in the map. Note that the User ID/Account ID is the unique ID of the user, not the username. For Mapillary and Mapilio, this is a set of numbers. For Panoramax, this is a GUID.

### Skip route sections with street-level coverage
With Windy Rural, enabling this means you can exclude sections that have already been covered based on your coverage filter, so it is not required to go through the section again. Traversing through this section is still possible to reach to an uncovered path.

| Option | Description|
|-|-|
| Coverage Threshold | How much of the section should already be covered to be excluded from route. |
|Proximity Threshold | How far to search if there is already coverage. |


## Navigation and Route Filter
The navigation filter can be used to exclude OSM ways that you do not want to traverse through. e.g. I do not want to drive on a footway.

The route filter is only available for Windy Rural. This is for OSM ways that have not been filtered out by the navigation filter where you can use this to mark OSM ways as traversable but only if necessary to get to other required ways. e.g. If you are a cyclist and can ride on a footway but do not need to cover footways.

## Export GPX
Once you are happy with the generated route, press 'Export GPX' to save the .gpx file for navigation! 

Unfortunately, most navigation apps are only designed for A to B or point to point navigation which makes it difficult to view the many [overlapping paths](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/issues/9975) of an area. So, what are some navigation apps you can use? There is my [modded OsmAnd](https://github.com/seen-one/OsmAnd) or I have also found [Locus Map](https://www.locusmap.app/) can work. I would love to know if there are more.

## Features that was on my list (but I'm too tired ):
* Consolidate intersections (previously we had OSMnx that could do it)
* Turn restrictions
* Local storage remembering settings and location
* Browser location retrieval
* Better U-turn avoidance

## Some Technical Details
Route Crafter uses leaflet.js for the interface and to display the map. All of the data is retrieved from Overpass API. For the route solver algorithms, [ArcRoutingLibrary](https://github.com/Olibear/ArcRoutingLibrary) is used but written in Java. With significant [modifications](https://github.com/seen-one/ArcRoutingLibrary/), TeaVM is used to compile the Java code into JavaScript and run the code directly in-browser. No server-side processing required!

The [previous version](https://github.com/seen-one/Route-Crafter/tree/everystreet) of Route Crafter uses the [everystreet](https://github.com/matejker/everystreet) library. This uses Python with only undirected route support but with somewhat better U-turn avoidance modifications by me.

## Debug Menu
Append [?debug](https://route.crafter.seen.one/?debug) to end of the URL to show the debug menu. After a roads have been fetched, clicking 'Export Largest Component OARLib' will create an .oarlib file suitable for the unmodified ArcRoutingLibrary .jar file. Download [here](https://github.com/Olibear/ArcRoutingLibrary/releases/tag/1.0.1) and use the commands as shown [here](https://github.com/Olibear/ArcRoutingLibrary/blob/master/HOW_TO_USE.txt) to generate the solution. Paste the solution and click 'Apply Solution (Largest Component)' and it will be applied as the solution which can be used to play or download the .gpx route.
